# Machine_Learning_mini_projects

This repository contains several small projects completed as part of a machine learning class. Each project focuses on different algorithms and techniques in the field of machine learning.

1. **Linear Regression:** This project explores linear regression models and their application in predicting continuous variables based on given features. It demonstrates how to train, evaluate, and interpret linear regression models using various datasets.

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** In this project, Support Vector Machines are implemented for both classification and regression tasks. It showcases the versatility of SVMs in dealing with different types of data and provides insights into tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

3. **Boosting:** The boosting project investigates ensemble learning methods such as AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting. It highlights the power of combining weak learners to create a strong predictive model and demonstrates the advantages of boosting algorithms in handling complex datasets.
